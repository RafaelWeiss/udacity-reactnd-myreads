# MyReads Project for Udacity React Developer NanoDegree

This is the final project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

### Installing

To download the project follow the instructions bellow:

```
git clone https://github.com/rafaelweiss/udacity-reactnd-myreads
cd udacity-reactnd-myreads
```

Then install dependencies and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
